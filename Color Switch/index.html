      <h2>Proposal for Interactive Experience: "Color Quest"</h2>
    
      <p>"Color Quest" is a playful and simple interactive game where players use real-world objects to match colors
      displayed on a screen. The game tests memory and visual recognition as players hunt for objects that match a given
      color. The interaction relies on the ml5.js library and p5.js to detect colors from real-world objects through a
      webcam, creating a seamless and fun experience.</p>


    <p>Objective:Players will be presented with a single color and must find an object in their environment that matches it. Once
      an object is presented to the webcam, the system evaluates whether it matches the target color and gives feedback
      on the result.</p>
