      <h2>Proposal for Interactive Experience: "Emoji Face-Off"</h2>

      <p>Emoj Face-Off challenges players to solve riddles and pick the emoji that best answers or represents
        the scenario described in the riddle. Players can compete friends to see who can react fastest and
        most accurately to the riddles. Each riddle will describe a scenario, and players must choose the emoji that
        best fits the clue.</p>


      <p>How it Works:


        Players are presented with a riddle or a short description of a situation.
        The player needs to quickly guess the emoji that best represents the riddle.
        Emojis could be displayed as options, and the player must choose one.
        Example Riddle: "I'm always smiling and love to have fun. Who am I?"
        Answer: üòÑ (Happy Emoji)
        






      </p>
      <p>The game displays a riddle and presents a selection of emojis.
        Players make en emoji with their face or find an object to present to the camera they think answers the riddle.
        Points are awarded based on how quickly the player selects the correct emoji and how accurate the choice is.
     
      
        "I love food, and I eat all day long!" (Answer: üçï)
        "What emoji would you use when you‚Äôre feeling a scared" (Answer: üò±)</p>
