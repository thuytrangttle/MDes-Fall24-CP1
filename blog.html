    <h4>Programming Design Systems:</h4>

    “If graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant.”
    <ul> I find this relatable for today's aspiring designer, as I've had to challenge myself to develop technical
        skills to remain a competitive candidate. To continue being an asset to my company and clients, I must at least
        think beyond pretty interfaces and consider how the system works as a whole. This is evident in Figma's lastest
        featues updates, which focuses on bridging the gap between design and code. Being aware of how design interacts
        with code also allows designers to create more cohesive experiences.
    </ul>
    "Design systems offer a different way of thinking, where the designer is forced to consider many scenarios and
    constraints instead of relying on a one-off design process."
    <ul> This was the reason I became so invested in learning about design systems. It challenges me to go beyond just
        solving immediate design
        problems and instead focus on creating flexible solutions that can adapt across products. In the long run, it
        builds consistency and saves time.
    </ul>
    "The concept of a grid system has so far served two purposes. First, it is the byproduct of the technical
    manufacturing processes of design products. The printing press works by assembling small rectangular letter blocks
    on a plate, so the designer has to think about the design process in terms of a grid. In this case, the grid is a
    concrete limitation that designers have to work around. Secondly, grid systems are also a design methodology used by
    designers to achieve organized layouts even in places that do not have such technical limitations.""

    <ul>The origins of grid systems in printing illustrate how technology shapes design practices. The necessity to
        align typeset letters on a grid reflects the limitations of early printing methods, forcing designers to adopt a
        structured approach. This is aligned with the notion that designer's must learn technical skills to remain
        relavant. While grids offer a foundation, they are not rigid rules. Designers often adapt or break grids to
        achieve specific artistic goals or to reflect the brand identity.

    </ul>

    <h4>What Do Prototypes Prototype?</h4>

    "If the role is well understood, but the goal of the artifact is to present its functionality in a novel way, then
    prototyping must focus on how the artifact will
    look and feel. If the artifact's func- tionality is to be based on a new technique, ques- tions of how to implement
    the design may be the focus of prototyping efforts."
    <ul>
        This is significant because it highlights two main ways of prototyping: design exploration and
        technical implementation. If the goal is to refine the user experience or visual design, prototypes should focus
        on the look and feel of the product. If the goal is to test functionality or new technology, prototyping should
        prioritize how things work.
    </ul>

    "Clarifying what aspects of a prototype correspond to the even- tual artifact—and what don't—is a key part of suc-
    cessful prototyping."

    <ul>t's not always obvious how a prototype correspnds to the final product. It takes many converations with between
        design and dev team to make sure there are no misunderstandings and that edge cases and limitations are
        accounted
        for. It's easy to desgn in a siloe anf end up wasting time and effort effort on irrelevant features and
        misaligned
        expectations.

    </ul>
    "Again, while team members learn to interpret abstract kinds of prototypes accurately, less expert audiences cannot
    normally be expected to understand such approxi- mate representations."

    <ul>
        This is a great reminder that as designers and product builders, we often get comfortable with our shorthand—using
        abstract, unfinished prototypes to convey ideas. But it's easy to forget that outside stakeholders or users won't
        have that same context.
    </ul>
