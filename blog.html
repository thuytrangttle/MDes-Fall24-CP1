    <h4>Programming Design Systems:</h4>

    “If graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant.”
    <ul> I find this relatable for today's aspiring designer, as I've had to challenge myself to develop technical
        skills to remain a competitive candidate. To continue being an asset to my company and clients, I must at least
        think beyond pretty interfaces and consider how the system works as a whole. This is evident in Figma's lastest
        featues updates, which focuses on bridging the gap between design and code. Being aware of how design interacts
        with code also allows designers to create more cohesive experiences.
    </ul>
    "Design systems offer a different way of thinking, where the designer is forced to consider many scenarios and
    constraints instead of relying on a one-off design process."
    <ul> This was the reason I became so invested in learning about design systems. It challenges me to go beyond just
        solving immediate design
        problems and instead focus on creating flexible solutions that can adapt across products. In the long run, it
        builds consistency and saves time.
    </ul>
    "The concept of a grid system has so far served two purposes. First, it is the byproduct of the technical
    manufacturing processes of design products. The printing press works by assembling small rectangular letter blocks
    on a plate, so the designer has to think about the design process in terms of a grid. In this case, the grid is a
    concrete limitation that designers have to work around. Secondly, grid systems are also a design methodology used by
    designers to achieve organized layouts even in places that do not have such technical limitations.""
   
    <ul>The origins of grid systems in printing illustrate how technology shapes design practices. The necessity to
        align typeset letters on a grid reflects the limitations of early printing methods, forcing designers to adopt a
        structured approach. This is aligned with the notion that designer's must learn technical skills to remain
        relavant. While grids offer a foundation, they are not rigid rules. Designers often adapt or break grids to
        achieve specific artistic goals or to reflect the brand identity.
