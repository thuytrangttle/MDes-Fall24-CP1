    <h3>Week 7 Assignment</h3>

    <p>Programming Design Systems:</p>

    “If graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant.”
    <ul> I find this relatable for today's aspiring designer, as I've had to challenge myself to develop technical
        skills to remain a competitive candidate. To continue being an asset to my company and clients, I must at least
        think beyond pretty interfaces and consider how the system works as a whole. This is evident in Figma's lastest
        featues updates, which focuses on bridging the gap between design and code. Being aware of how design interacts
        with code also allows designers to create more cohesive experiences.
    </ul>
    Design systems offer a different way of thinking, where the designer is forced to consider many scenarios and
    constraints instead of relying on a one-off design process.
    <ul> This was the reason I became so invested in learning about design systems. It challenges me to go beyond just
        solving immediate design
        problems and instead focus on creating flexible solutions that can adapt across products. In the long run, it
        builds consistency and saves time.

    </ul>
